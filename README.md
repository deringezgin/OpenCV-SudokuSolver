# openCV_sudoku
An interactive sudoku solver implementation using OpenCV in Python.

• Developed a Sudoku solver using OpenCV that goes beyond traditional solvers by allowing users to input any Sudoku board photo.
• Implemented features like contour detection, perspective transform, digit recognition, etc., to extract and solve the sudoku board.
• Created a user-friendly validation process to allow users to manually mark the corners for the board and fix the detected numbers alongside the automated image processing.
